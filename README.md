# Advent of Code 2020: Problems solved with Python

These are my answers for the advent of Code 2020 challenge. I use Python
as my main programming language. 

Python has many useful builtin features or functions that can be used to 
solve problems as stated in "Advent of Code". I hope to highlight these 
features by solving the problems and hope this encourages people to read the
Python documentation more when they are trying to tackle a problem.
