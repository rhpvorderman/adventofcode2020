# Advent of Code 2020: Problems solved with Python

These are my answers for the [Advent of Code 2020](
https://adventofcode.com/2020/) challenge. I use Python as my main programming 
language for this exercise. 

Python has many useful builtin features or functions that can be used to 
solve problems as stated in "Advent of Code". I hope to highlight these 
features by solving the problems and hope this encourages people to read the
Python documentation more when they are trying to tackle a problem.
